# gmbtools
A set of utilities for DEM processing/analysis, calculating geodetic mass balance, and plotting

Generic tools (some still have hardcoded paths):
- `make_mos.sh` - create 2, 8 and 32-m tiled mosaics, count maps, indices, etc. from a set of input DEMs
- `mb_parallel.py` - compute geodetic mass balance for a set of input glacier polygons and two DEM sources
- `mb_plot.py` - create regional mass balance plots
- `lag_dz.py` - create Lagrangian Dh/Dt products (adapted from old script, needs refactoring)
- `dem_gallery.py` - create gallery plot for many input DEMs
- `dem_anomaly.py` - create anomaly maps and animations

Application specific tools for CONUS and HMA, some can and will be generalized.

Continental US (CONUS) tools:
- `get_snotel.py` and `swe.py` - query and extract SNOTEL records, use to create SWE maps from DEM dh/dt (need to be combined)
- `prism.py` - create seasonal PRISM temp and precip products
- `mb_bar_plot.py` - create seasonal/annual mass balance bar plot (currently SCG, should add cumulative panel)
- `lidar_proc.sh` - clean up LiDAR data
- `process_usgs_dem.py` - clean up USGS DEMs generated by M. Fahey from NTM and DG imagery using ERDAS Imagine+LPS
- `conus_site_poly.py` - filter available DEMS for sites of interest and generate time series stack products

High-mountain Asia (HMA):
